#Cine Match - Movie Recommender App  

## Overview  
The Cine Match is a machine learning-based system that provides personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and interactions. It employs collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to enhance the user experience on movie platforms. Built using Python and Streamlit, this project processes movie metadata and user behavior to generate relevant suggestions.  

## Features  
- Search and browse movies from the dataset  
- Generate personalized movie recommendations  
- Machine learning-based filtering techniques  
- Fast performance with precomputed similarity matrices  
- Interactive web interface using Streamlit  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Pickle (for model persistence)
